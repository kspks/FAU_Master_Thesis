## Hypergraph $p$-Laplace operators for Image Denoising. 
### Master Thesis by Kseniia Lukin.

Master of Science (M.Sc.) in Computational and Applied Mathematics (CAM) at the Department of Mathematics at the Friedrich-Alexander University Erlangen-Nuremberg. 

The code provided in this repository shows practical applications in image processing using unoriented hypergraphs. Averaging operators for unoriented hypergraphs emerge as a new way to capture local and nonlocal relationships within images. With a special focus on image denoising, this chapter validates the effectiveness through numerical experiments
that bridge the theoretical and empirical domains.
More details can be found in my master's thesis, which is also attached in this repository under the name "[Master_Thesis_Kseniia_Lukin](Master_Thesis_Kseniia_Lukin.pdf)".
